Here are solutions in Haskell some of the problems appearing on the [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) website. These are by no means the best solutions; your own solutions might well be better, shorter and faster.

I have written multiple solutions for some of the problems, either by changing the algorithms or changing the implementations of the supporting functions.

For example, a function that uses list comprehensions can also be implemented using list monads or the map-filter-reduce functions or structural recursion. For other problems I have hinted at what strategies other solutions could use but have stopped short of implementing them.
